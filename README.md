## Developers

The `main` branch is for stuff which is already released into the plugin available in the plugin marketplace. The `dev` branch contains some much cooler experimental features which will gradually make their way into the `main` branch.

If you are interested in building your own plugins, taking a look through the source code for this plugin (as well as the other example plugins and plugins built by the community) would be a great starting point. Of course, you should also check out the official documentation, guides and tutorials on our [plugin website](https://plugins.remnote.com/).
